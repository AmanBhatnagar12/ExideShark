## Steps to get the program

**Step 1:** Get the executable file via wget:

    git clone https://github.com/ppranav06/exideshark

**Step 2:** Change permissions to make file as executable after switching to the directory

    cd exideshark
    chmod +x ./exideshark.sh

**Step 3:** Run the executable with **sudo** (not as root user)

    sudo ./exideshark.sh
