# initial-setup
Initial Setup - installing programs and stuff after a fresh fedora install, completely automated. 
Now for Fedora alone (my current distro)
Inspiration from Anthony of LTT

## Steps to get the program
**Step 1:** Install **git** in your system
    Command: `sudo dnf install git -y`
**Step 2:** Clone this folder to your device
    Command: `git clone https://github.com/ppranav06/initial-setup`
**Step 3:** Change permissions to make file as executable after switching to the directory
    Command: `chmod +x ./setup`
**Step 4:** Run the executable with *sudo* (else won't run)
    Command: `sudo ./setup`
