# initial-setup
Initial Setup - installing programs and stuff after a fresh fedora install, completely automated. 
Now for Fedora alone (my current distro)

_Inspiration from Anthony of LTT_

## Steps to get the program
**Step 1:** Get the executable file via wget:

    wget https://github.com/ppranav06/initial-setup/raw/main/setup

**Step 2:** Change permissions to make file as executable after switching to the directory

    chmod +x ./setup

**Step 4:** Run the executable with *sudo* (else won't execute)

    sudo ./setup
